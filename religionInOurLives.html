    <p class="text">To start off, let's give ourselves a reminder of what the First Amendment is. It states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."-<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/#:~:text=Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States,-First%20Amendment&text=Congress%20shall%20make%20no%20law,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances." class="text">Congress.gov</a> Specfically, we're looking at the part that reads "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..." It clearly states that it will not pass any law respecting the establishment of religion, and yet, saying the Pledge of Allegiance is law. So is that considered an establishment of religion? My answer, yes. While the law to say the Pledge of Allegiance isn't enforced, it still violates the First Amendment, even though it isn't doing so directly.</p>
